A game for the mandatory assignment

### How to run:
1. Run server
  - Open a terminal 
  - Navigate to root folder `team-local-tactics/`
  - Run server with `py server.py`
2. Run clients
  - Open two seperate terminals

Client will attempt to autoconnect on run, so server must be running before you can run the client
